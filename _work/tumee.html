responsibilities:
    - title: Bring TuMee development in-house
      summary: Refactored the iOS mobile application in small iterations to address poor performance and slow feature velocity. Did so by gradually fixing bugs, modularizing and improving naming of unreadable code, removing logical inconsistencies, and using built-in code where possible.
    - title: General software development
      summary: "Developed and maintained software at all levels in the tech stack: mobile app, backend APIs, server and database, and managing the cloud server."
    - title: Plan and execute changes to software across company pivot
      summary: Planned and adapted changes to the software through a company pivot. Technologically this meant revisiting the core business services and updating the rules, developing a new mobile application to match the new branding, a new API to support the new functionality, setting up a new server with database; all this while reusing as much as possible from old business model.
