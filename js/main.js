It had its benefits like no commuting, flexible hours, and its casual dress code. But it had many downsides I had to work through. Home is normally a relaxing space we rest, we sleep, we treat ourselves, and have fun. It required discipline to stay focused on work and stay away from procrastinations and distractions. It requires you manage time effectively not doing so can mean you do not get the work done or spend too much time working and see dimishing results in your work and quality of life. You need to be mentally strong to fight off mental illness due lack of socialization. I quickly discovered the need to maintain balanced work life. I started weight lifting, jogging, hiking, and prioritizing time with friends and family.</div>        </div>    </div></section><div class="gray-background">    <section class="site-section">        <h2 class="fs-title text-center">CaseAide® Note</h2>        <p class="text-center">CaseAide ® Note is a user-defined mobile keyboard reducing the time spent documenting notes.
