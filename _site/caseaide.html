              <div class="h3">Header 1</div>
              <div class="body2">I was the go-to software developer for CaseAide, this meant I worked where CaseAide needed me. Moving between the Note and Scholar products and their various components. One moment I'd be working on integrating permission based policy into the keyboard, the next moment I'd be working on a hotfix for the API and deploying it to production. I also frequently worked with the development team to assist them in finding solutions for new requirements. Finally, I was responsible for distributing production and test builds through the App Store and Play Store as needed. It was a rewarding, fast-paced environment driven by need.</div>

              <div class="h3">Header 2</div>
              <div class="body2">I started working from home as an independent contractor since graduating in late 2015. It had its benefits like no commuting, flexible hours, and its casual dress code. But it had many downsides I had to work through. Home is usually a relaxing space we rest, we sleep, we treat ourselves, and have fun. It required discipline to stay focused on work and stay away from procrastination and distractions. It requires you to manage time effectively not doing so can mean you do not get the work done or spend too much time working and see diminishing results in your work and quality of life. You need to be mentally strong to fight off mental illness due to lack of socialization. I quickly discovered the need to maintain a balanced work life. I started weight lifting, jogging, hiking, and prioritizing time with friends and family.</div>

CaseAide Scholar was the winner of the Innovation Challenge in 2017 hosted by the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship, and both CaseAide® Note and Scholar were also featured by the Southern Area Consortium of Human Services on pg. 9</div>
