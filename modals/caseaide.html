            <div class="fs-normal">I was the go-to software developer for CaseAide, this meant I worked where CaseAide needed me. Moving between the Note and Scholar products and their various components. One moment i&#39;d be working on integrating permission based policy into the the keyboard, the next moment i&#39;d be working on a hotfix for the API and deploying it to production. I also frequently worked with the development team to assist them with finding solutions for new requirements. Finally I was responsible for distributing production and test builds through the App Store and and Play Store as needed. It was a rewarding fast-pased environment driven by need.</div>

            <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Work-life balance</h3>
            <div class="fs-normal">I started working from home as independent contractor since graduating in late 2015. It had its benefits like no commuting, flexible hours, and its casual dress code. But it had many downsides I had to work through. Home is normally a relaxing space we rest, we sleep, we treat ourselves, and have fun. It required discipline to stay focused on work and stay away from procrastinations and distractions. It requires you manage time effectively not doing so can mean you do not get the work done or spend too much time working and see dimishing results in your work and quality of life. You need to be mentally strong to fight off mental illness due lack of socialization. I quickly discovered the need to maintain balanced work life. I started weight lifting, jogging, hiking, and prioritizing time with friends and family.</div>
