            <div class="fs-normal">I interviewed for a software development position in the summer of 2014 at the recommendation of Professor Arturo Concepcion. But unfortunately was not offered the job. It was disappointing, but I decided to collaborate with the team unpaid through independent study for the experience. After 3 months of work they decided to hire me due to my strong work ethic, capacity to learn fast, and be a team player. I continued to work with the team until the day I graduated!</div>

            <div class="fs-normal">This was my first job as a software developer where I got to experience the real deal. I had responsibilities, meetings, presentations, project requirements, deadlines, I had to plan and deliver. I worked closely with clients to understand their vision, and wrote up concrete requirements for their expectations, and continued to work with them through the mobile apps lifecycle. I collaborated with other developers and departments to meet the universities standards in accessibility, security, and branding. I presented in front of University leaders across the CSU, assisted students in CSE 455 course, and underwent specialized training. Most importantly I had figure out what I need to know and go out and learn it.</div>
